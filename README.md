# duckduckgo-html-search
A browser WebExtension that adds https://html.duckduckgo.com/ as a search engine.
This can be useful when users have disabled JavaScript with NoScript, for example.
Prevents a needless redirect from the default script-enabled search URL.

See also the DuckDuckGo Lite Search extension by Andis Spriņķis, which also avoids
the redirect, but using the minimal "Lite" layout.

Available for
- Mozilla Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ddg-html-search-provider/
